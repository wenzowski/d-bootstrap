A Derby component library based on Twitter Bootstrap.

This package does not contain any of the Bootstrap styles or fonts. Include
them yourself using `app.loadStyles(__dirname + '/path/to/bootstrap/css')`.

# Contributors wanted!

This project should implement each of the [Bootstrap JavaScript plugins](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/) as Derby components.
